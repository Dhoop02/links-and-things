    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This is an example on how to do links and <a href="../images/images.html">images</a></p>

    <p>This page is about links. What are they? What are the differences?</p>

    <ul>Absolute</ul>
    <ul>Relative</ul>

    <P>The differences? Absolute goes from your home site to a another site not located within your umbrella. Realative on the other hand navigates within your current ecosystem.</P>
